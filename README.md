# animal-trading-cards
Animal Trading Cards Project for Udacity's Web Nanodegree Programs.
In this project, I had the opportunity to demonstrate my new web development skills by recreating a webpage from a design prototype. This is a common workflow for front-end web developers. Typically, we are provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated into an actual, functional website. The design prototype used in this project was inspired by trading cards and featured a fish you might recognize from a popular animated film. I created multiple cards like this, swapping out the fish with an animal of my choice.
